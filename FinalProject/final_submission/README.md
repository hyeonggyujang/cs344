For the Final project, a GAN (Generative Adverserial Network) is built.
To view the version that was used for the showcase, please view updates.ipynb
To view the final report version, please view report.ipynb

Description:
  A GAN is a network of two programs that's composed of two NNs (Neural Networks): a generator(Gen) and a discriminator(Dis).
  The purpose of Gen is to create counterfeit images that look "real" enough to trick Dis.
  The purpose of Dis is to create a NN that could distinguish the real data from the counterfeit data.
  By creating the adversarial network, each of Gen and Dis would compete with each other, improving their performance.
  
  In this project, two versions of GAN are implemented, one provided by Chollet and the other provided by Atienza.
  The GANs used in this project is called Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) which utilizes deep convolutional layers implemented from Keras library.
