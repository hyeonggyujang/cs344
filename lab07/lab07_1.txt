a.
Exercise 1:
cities['San and pop>50'] = (cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: 'San' in val) & cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda val: val > 50))
cities
Exercise 2:
cities.reindex([1, 0, 2, 3])
Using the indices outside of the scope is allowed for reindex function as this function fills in NaN's for the missing rows.
b.

c.
Shuffling is important that the split input dataset into the ML training should avoid any bias or patterns.
