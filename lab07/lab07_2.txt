a.
Categorical data is character type. Even though it could have numbers as categorical data, those numbers would be strings.
Numerical data is numbers.
b.
task1:
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00002,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=10
)
hyperparameters: learning rate = 0.00002, steps = 500, batch_size = 10
RMSE: 168.18
task2:
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00002,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=10,
    input_feature="population"
)
hyperparameters: learning rate = 0.00002, steps = 1000, batch_size = 10
RMSE: 176.05
c.
The hyperparameters are the parameters set before the training begins.
Depending on the values of the hyperparameters, the efficiency and the accuracy of the model prediction would vary.
There isn't a "standard" tuning algorithm for them, but depending on the type of the inadequacy of the model, different hyperparameters could be changed.
