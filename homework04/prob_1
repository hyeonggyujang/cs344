	Speculate on whether you believe that so-called “deep” neural networks are destined to be another bust just as perceptrons and expert systems were in the past, or whether they really are a breakthrough that will be used for years into the future.

	It's hard at this point to assess those "deep" neural networks' value, as the technology has not yet met the limit of their capacity. We could say perceptrons and expert systems were of the past not so promising today, because we have seen the limit of their ability while we are still in demand of higher quality of ability. If we find out that those deep neural networks have substantiable potentials for the development, then we could say those deep neural networks are different from the past technologies like perceptrons and expert systems, but if the neural networks stop developing because of they would have reached a limit, then they are essentially the same as the past technologies. 

	However, there are at least some differences in approaching to solve problems between deep neural networks and those past technologies. The salient difference is how they formulate their algorithms. For deep learning, the developers would not setup the exact algorithms, but rather leave the formation of the algorithms to the machines. For perceptrons and expert systems, the developer would have to define the calculation/classification algorithms to solve a specific problem. Such difference has affected the scope of AI influence. The application scope for the deep neural networks is much wider that that of perceptrons or of expert systems. As the scope of influence is wider for the deep neural networks, it would take some time to feel the limit of these techonologies, which wouldn't allow us to assess how successful deep neural network could be for sure.
