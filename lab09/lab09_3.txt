i.
The input training size is 2000, but the original size is 25000.
total training cat images: 1000
total training dog images: 1000
total validation cat images: 500
total validation dog images: 500
ii.
The convnet in this execise has more convolutional layers than what we did in the class. 
iii.
The intermediate images resemble the shape of cats.

data augmentation: "artificially boosting the diversity and number of training examples by performing random transformations to existing images to create a set of new variants."
