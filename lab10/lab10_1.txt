a.
 Depending on the purpose, I could use either Keras or TensorFlow for different purpose. If I am satisfied with a lot of defaults assumed by the library, then I would use Keras, but if I want to control subtle details in building NN then I would use TensorFlow.

dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    steps=5000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 2],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

    Final RMSE (on training data):   104.74
	Final RMSE (on validation data): 104.98
	(no overfitting observed)
