Given:
  isOn(a, b)
  isOn(b, c)
  supports(table, c)
  supports(x, y) => isOn(y, x)
  isOn(y, x) => isAbove(y, x)
  (isAbove(y, x) ^ isAbove(x, z)) => isAbove(y, z)

Prove: 
  isAbove(a, table)


Proof:

  Conclusion 1: 
    given supports(table, c),
    from supports(x, y) => isOn(y, x),
    by setting x as table, and y as c,
    we get isOn(c, table).

  Conclusion 2:
    given isOn(a, b),
    from isOn(y, x) => isAbove(y, x),
    by setting y as a and x as b,
    we get isAbove(a, b).

  Conclusion 3:
    given isOn(b, c),
    from isOn(y, x) => isAbove(y, x),
    by setting y as b, and x as c,
    we get isAbove(b, c).

  Conclusion 4:
    given isOn(c, table),   # conclusion 1
    from isOn(y, x) => isAbove(y, x),
    by setting y as c, and x as table,
    we get isAbove(c, table).

  Conclusion 5:
    given isAbove(b, c) and isAbove(c, table),   # conclusion 3 and 4
    from (isAbove(y, x) ^ isAbove(x, z)) => isAbove(y, z),
    by setting y as b, x as c, and z as table,
    we get isAbove(b, table).

  Conclusion 6:
    given isAbove(a, b) and isAbove(b, table),   # conclusion 2 and 5
    from (isAbove(y, x) ^ isAbove(x, z)) => isAbove(y, z),
    by setting y as a, x as b, and z as table,
    we get isAbove(a, table).

  Proof ends.
